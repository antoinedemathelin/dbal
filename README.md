# Discrepancy-Based Active Learning for Domain Adaptation

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the notebooks:
- `tensorflow` (>= 2.0)
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` (for visualization)

Besides the [`adapt`](https://github.com/antoinedemathelin/adapt) package has been used for TrAdaBoost 


## Experiments

The experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets:
- Superconductivity [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/superconductivty+data#)
- Office [Berkeley](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jhoffman/domainadapt/#datasets_code)
- Digits [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/),  [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/)
